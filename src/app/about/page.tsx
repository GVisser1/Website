        Hi! I'm a QA Engineer and a huge nerd. I spend my work days ensuring the quality of software, and in my free
        time, I love listening to music, watching films, playing games, and coding. Hereâ€™s a bit about what I enjoy:
      </p>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        The one thing I do everyday is listening to music and exploring different genres and artists. Collecting vinyl
        records and attending concerts are some of my favourite pastimes. If you're curious about my musical tastes,
        check out my playlists and listening history on{" "}
        <InlineLink href="https://open.spotify.com/user/iglenn2345">Spotify</InlineLink> and{" "}
        <InlineLink href="https://last.fm/user/instaglenn">LastFM</InlineLink>.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favourite albums are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nas - Illmatic</li>
        <li>The National - High Violet</li>
        <li>Father John Misty - Pure Comedy</li>
        <li>Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You</li>
        <li>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Going to concerts is a passion of mine. Every year, I try to attend as many as possible, and while it's not
        great for my wallet, it's absolutely worth it. I've been fortunate enough to see some of my favourite artists
        live, such as Fleet Foxes, The National, and Kendrick Lamar.
      </p>

      <h2>Movies and Shows</h2>
      <p>
        I love watching movies and TV shows, and I have a growing collection of Blu-rays. From timeless classics to the
        latest blockbusters, I enjoy exploring different genres and directors. I am always up for a good horror movie,
        so if you have any recommendations, feel free to share them with me. You can find my movie ratings and reviews
        on <InlineLink href="https://letterboxd.com/iGlenn/">Letterboxd</InlineLink>.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my all-time favourite films include masterpieces like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paddington 2</li>
        <li>The Darjeeling Limited</li>
        <li>Arrival</li>
      </ul>
      When it comes to TV shows I love series like
      <ul>
        <li>The Wire</li>
        <li>Succession</li>
        <li>Avatar The Last Airbender</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also love going to the movies, often multiple times a month. Experiencing a film on the big screen is a
        special experience that I always look forward to. But when the theatre is filled with people who can't stop
        talking or using their phones, I'd rather watch the movie at home. Luckily, this doesn't happen that often.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming is a big part of my life. I play a wide variety of games, from 3D platformers and open-world games to
        RPGs and first-person shooters. My favourite games are those with an engaging story or gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of my favourites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persona 5 Royal</li>
        <li>Bloodborne</li>
        <li>Super Mario Galaxy</li>
        <li>The Witcher 3</li>
        <li>Resident Evil 4</li>
      </ul>
      <Image src={persona5} alt="Persona 5" className="max-h-80 w-full rounded-2xl object-cover object-top" />
      <h2>Professional Life</h2>
      <p>

        <InlineLink href="https://moreapp.com">MoreApp</InlineLink>. I am responsible for ensuring quality of the
        software, maintaining testing processes, and writing requirements. I love working closely with developers, UX

        Being part of a team that values collaboration and innovation is something I truly appreciate.
      </p>
