  "ABOUT_CONTENT": "Welcome to my website! My name is Glenn Visser and I live in Maassluis, Netherlands. I am a fourth year computer science student at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, who loves a challenge. During this study I was able to gain experience with the following languages and frameworks: Python, C#, HTML, CSS, .NET & SQL. I also did an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Minor.\n\nIn addition to my studies, I work part-time as a software engineer at the company MoreApp. MoreApp and I crossed paths in 2021 when I was looking for a place to do my internship, and after that I sort of stuck around. MoreApp helps companies stop using paper forms by providing a digital alternative that is safe and environmentally friendly. As a Software Engineer I mostly work on the frontend side of our application with languages and tools such as TypeScript, React & TailwindCSS. Currently I am trying to expand my developer toolkit by working on backend issues in Java.\n\nIn my spare time I play video games, experiment with programming, watch movies and shows, listen to a lot of music, go to concerts and like to walk. Chances are I'm listening to music right now.",

  "HOBBIES_GAMES_DESCRIPTION": "I also regularly play video games. When I was 8 I got my first GameBoy, on which I played Pokémon LeafGreen for hours. And when I was 9, I was already played GTA San Andreas and Tomb Raider on the computer. Around this time I also got my first Playstation console (the Playstation 2). This is where my love for video games really started. Nowadays I mainly play on Playstation. But you will also see me pick up the Nintendo Switch for Mario, Zelda or Pokémon.\n\nIt's amazing to see the progress the gaming industry has made. I always like looking back at games where I said, 'Wow, this looks just like real-life'. Usually I'm shocked when I return to these games after playing a recent, breathtaking game like Horizon: Forbidden West, because the graphics haven't really held up and don't look like real life at all.\n\nThe image above shows a small part of my game collection. As you may have noticed, I am a big fan of physical media. \n\nHere are some of my favorite games:",
  "HOBBIES_MOVIES_DESCRIPTION": "Another big hobby of mine is watching movies and series. Whether at home or at the cinema, I love doing it. So you will often find me in the cinema. As the image from my blu-ray collection above shows, I don't really have a favorite genre. I'm open to anything, whether it's animation, action, or drama. During a Pixar movie, I probably won't keep it dry.\n\nLike movies, I also like to watch series. You can definitely wake me up at night for a series like Better Call Saul or The Wire.\n\nHere are some of my favorite movies:",
  "HOBBIES_MUSIC_DESCRIPTION": "My biggest hobby is listening to music. Ever since I was little I have been obsessed with music. This obsession all started with Michael Jackson. Over the years I have started listening to more and more different genres. Hip hop is by far my favorite, but you will often hear me listening to pop, folk, R&B, soul and many other genres. I also try to see as many artists live as possible. For example, I've been to Kendrick Lamar, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Anderson .Paak & Conway the Machine.\n\nThe image above shows part of my vinyl collection. I've been collecting these since 2018. The first record I bought was Pusha T's Daytona. I already have 100+ records.\n\nHere are some of my favorite albums:",

  "PROJECTS_BITFILM_CONTENT": "During the second half of my first year of study, I made a ticket reservation system with my project group. The system is built with the GUI WinForms and is programmed in C#. With Bitfilm it is possible to order movie tickets.\n\nA ticket can be ordered by selecting seats and entering some personal data. Admins of the system can also add and remove movies. Every movie has its own page, with a description, trailer and more. All the data is stored in a local database using SQLite.",
  "PROJECTS_BITMAIL_CONTENT": "During the first half of my second year of study, I made a mail system with my project group. This was part of Project C and was commissioned by Ranshuijsen B.V. The system is built with the Blazor web framework and is programmed in C#, HTML and CSS.\n\nWith Bitmail it is possible to send emails to a group of people based on labels. Mailing is done using Mailchimp. A label must contain contacts in order to send an email. When creating a label, contacts can be linked to it. A contact has an e-mail address and can be linked to an organization. All data is stored in a server-based database with MySQL.",
  "PROJECTS_BITFIT_CONTENT": "During the second half of my second year of study, I made an application/ prototype which helps a user with checking their endurance and creating training schedules. This was part of Project D and was commissioned by BLIS Digital. The application is built with the Blazor web framework and is programmed in C#, HTML and CSS. All the data is stored in a local database using SQLite.\n\nWith Bitfit it is possible to check the status of your endurance. The state of a user’s endurance level is calculated using the resting heart rate and their VO₂max. The resting heart rate can be retrieved from a Fitbit account. The user can generate a trainingschedule. This schedule consists of three types of exercises: HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), Endurance and a Strength training. The difficulty is based on the user’s endurance.",
  "PROJECTS_CLICKER_GAME_CONTENT": "This clicker game is a side project of mine. In June 2020 I started experimenting with Unity and this game is the result. The app is far from finished. I plan to return to this project in the near future.\n\nThe game is made with Unity and is programmed in C#. The aim of the game is to click on the wheat icon so that you can harvest it. Harvested wheat can be sold, earning the player money. With money, players can buy upgrades.",
  "PROJECTS_WEBSITE_CONTENT": "This website was made with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and serves as a personal portfolio. I also use this site to play around with new technologies. I highly recommend checking out TailwindCSS. If you are still writing your own CSS classes then this wonderful library will literally change your life, trust me :)\n\nYou can learn a lot about me on the homepage. For example, what my favorite albums or films are, but also what my work experience looks like. On the page you are currently on, you can view all the projects I've worked on in recent years, both school and personal projects.\n\nBuilding this website has taught me a lot, if you have any questions about the creation of this site or any other topic, you can send me a message on the contact page.",
